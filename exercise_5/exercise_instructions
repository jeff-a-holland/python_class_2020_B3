The idea here is to create two functions. The first will listen on a socket
(on port 9999), and wait for connections to it.  The second will connect to
the server on port 9999.

The client can send one of three messages:

- "say".  The "say" message is followed by a string, which the server should
then repeat back.

- "increment".  The "increment" message is followed by an integer.  The server
responds with 1 more than that integer.

- "bye".  The "bye" message indicates that we want to hang up.  The server
responds with "bye", and then disconnects.

Any other message will result in an error message being sent from the server,
such as "I don't understand."  Trying to increment a non-integer will also
result in an error message being sent from the server.
