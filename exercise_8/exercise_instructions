Write a Python program that takes a directory name as a command-line argument, and
does the following with it:

- finds all of the *.mp4 files in that directory
- calculates the duration, in minutes, of each video
- creates a NumPy array or (my preference) a Pandas series from these durations
- displays the descriptive statistics for these durations, in minutes -- at the
  very least, min, max, mean, and std
- displays the total time, in hh:mm format, of the videos
