This week, we're going to implement our own, very simple version of "mypy",
which I call "mymypy".  This will not be a static code analyzer. Rather, it'll
work at runtime, via a decorator.

We can apply the "mymypy" decorator to a function, passing it a list of valid
types.  For example:

    @mymypy([int, int])
    def mul(a,b):
        return a*b
