On the server, you'll again have a number of functions defined, and a dict seems
like the best place to store them. But instead of the user sending commands which
correspond to functions, the user will name the function that should be invoked.

The response from the server will be the function's actual output, which can be
any built-in data type or combination thereof. That output will be pickle'd, and
the pickle output (a string) will then be sent to the client.  The client will
then un-pickle the response from the server, displaying not just the string
version of the object but also its type (for easier debugging).
