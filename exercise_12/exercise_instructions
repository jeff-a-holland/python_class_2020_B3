This week, we're going to experiment with creating a program that takes user
input from the command line.  To do this, we're going to use the "cmd" module,
part of the Python standard library.

The idea is that you'll use "cmd" to build a program that implements a simple
calculator.  Let's assume that the calculator's inputs will only be positive
integers; negative numbers and floats can be thrown out.  (This will make the
filtering of inputs a bit easier.)

Upon running the program, the user will be presented with a command prompt.
The possible commands are:
    add
    sub
    mul
    div

But it's not enough to enter a command.  You'll enter a command, followed by
one or more integers separated by spaces.  Thus, if you write:  add 1 2 3
the system will print "6" on the screen.

And if you write:  sub 10 5 3
the system will print "2" on the screen.

Anything that isn't a positive integer can be ignored.
Thus:  add 1 abc 2.3 -4 2 3
will also print "6" on the screen.

Now let's add an additional twist: I'd like to be able to enter my calculations
not only as words, but also as symbols.  Thus, I'd like to be able to say:
    + 1 2 3
    - 10 5 3
    * 1 2 3
    / 10 4

Using the symbols will be equivalent to using the words.

You can exit from the calculator either by entering EOF (the default way that
"cmd" expects people to exit, because everyone knows that "EOF" means "end of
file," and that stdin is just another file).  If you want to create a "quit"
command to coddle your users who aren't Unix-heads, then I'll grudgingly accept
that.
