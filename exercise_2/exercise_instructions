For this week's exercise, I want you to implement "tr" (the Unix command)
as a function that takes two strings, and returns a function that performs
the translation on a string. In other words, we should be able to do the following:

    vowels_to_y = tr('aeiou', 'y')
    print(vowels_to_y('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'))

and we should see:
    thy qyyck brywn fyx jymps yvyr thy lxzy dyg
