This week, we'll write a function that takes one or more filenames, each of which
is assumed to be a tarfile (with or without compression).  For each filename, the
function will create a new zipfile with the same contents, but (obviously) in ".zip"
format rather than in ".tar.gz" format.

I'm going to expect that in the current directory, we'll then have three files:
"foo.zip", "bar.zip", and "baz.zip", each of which will contain the same contents
as the respective tarfiles, but in zip format, instead.

If you get a file that cannot be untar'ed for whatever reason, then print an error
or warning message, but continue.  You can also pass a value to the "zippath"
parameter, indicating where you want the zipfile to be created. If you can write
the zip file to a staging directory, such as /tmp, even better.
